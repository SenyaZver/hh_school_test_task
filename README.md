# hh_school_test_task

A quick test task for Heads and Hands development school.
Here I implemented a base Creature class and two subclasses: Player and Monster. Creatures can heal, attack and recieve damage. All actions are logged into console for clarity. 
Creature's attack damage is calculated by the DamageCalculator interface which has a default implementation and testing implementation.

Implemented in Kotlin.


Note: Usecases can be seen in the Tester class.
